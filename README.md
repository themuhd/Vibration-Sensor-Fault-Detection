# Vibration-Sensor-Fault-Detection
Fault prediction performed from data on twenty vibration sensor readings



## Dataset
The dataset, FaultDataset.csv, consists of multiple rows, each containing twenty vibration sensor readings. The final column in the dataset is the target variable, where:

0 indicates that there was no fault with the machine at the time of the readings.
1 indicates that a fault was identified in the machine during the readings.
## Project Objective
Our primary objective is to develop a predictive maintenance model using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the sensor data, we aim to create a classification model that can accurately predict whether a fault exists in the machinery based on the vibration sensor readings.
